# The Impact of Facebook Post Features on Consumer Engagement

## Description
In the dynamic realm of digital marketing, the need for predictive models in social media has grown significantly. This project addresses a critical gap by focusing on forecasting user interactions with Facebook posts prior to their publication, utilizing linear regression analysis to develop a practical predictive tool. The aim is to enhance corporate communications' effectiveness on social networks, specifically focusing on predicting the number of unique users who interact with a post over its lifetime on a cosmetics brand's Facebook page. This metric denotes the number of unique users who interact with a post over its lifetime. The study employs a dataset from a cosmetics brand's Facebook page, incorporating eight key variables. The data is divided into 'Training' and 'Validation' sets to construct and validate the predictive model. Through rigorous analysis, the project uncovers insights into consumer engagement dynamics. The project concludes with strategic recommendations for businesses, highlighting actionable insights derived from the predictive model. These insights can guide corporate communication strategies on social media platforms, helping brands optimize their engagement efforts and enhance overall performance.

## Dataset
The worldwide dissemination of social media was triggered by the exponential growth of Internet users, leading to a completely new environment for customers to exchange ideas and feedback about products and services. The number of social network users in 2010 was 0.97 billion and was projected to increase to 2.44 billion users by 2018, i.e. an increase of around 300% in 8 years. Social media may become the most important media channel for brands to reach their clients. Moro et al. study the effect on the `Lifetime.Post.Consumers` with respect to the 7 input features: `category`, `page total likes`, `type`, `month`, `hour`, `weekday`, `paid`.
