# The Impact of Facebook Post Features on Consumer Engagement

## Description
In the realm of digital marketing, the demand for predictive models in social media has significantly increased. This project addresses this need by focusing on forecasting user interactions with Facebook posts prior to their publication, using linear regression analysis to develop a practical predictive tool. The goal is to improve corporate communications' effectiveness on social networks, specifically predicting the number of unique users who will interact with a post over its lifetime on a cosmetics brand's Facebook page. This metric represents the number of unique users interacting with a post during its lifespan. The study utilizes a dataset from a cosmetics brand's Facebook page, incorporating eight key variables. The data is divided into 'Training' and 'Validation' sets for constructing and validating the predictive model. Through thorough analysis, the project reveals insights into consumer engagement dynamics. It concludes with strategic recommendations for businesses, emphasizing actionable insights derived from the predictive model. These insights can inform corporate communication strategies on social media platforms, enabling brands to optimize their engagement efforts and improve overall performance.
