# The Impact of Facebook Post Features on Consumer Engagement

## Overview
This project provides a predictive analysis of user interactions with Facebook posts using a dataset from a cosmetics brand's page. The goal is to construct a model to forecast the number of people who click anywhere on a post ('Lifetime Post Consumers') by examining eight specific input features related to post content and timing. The study employs linear regression techniques to analyze posts and identify significant predictors of consumer engagement. This project underscores the value of understanding which post features most significantly impact engagement, enabling marketers to refine their content strategies. The insights gained can help brands optimize their posting schedules and content types, leading to more effective social media marketing campaigns. The findings empower businesses to make data-driven decisions, enhancing their social media presence and overall marketing efforts.

## Objective
The primary aim is to use linear regression techniques to uncover patterns in user engagement and identify significant variables influencing consumer interaction on Facebook. The insights gained from this analysis can help marketers optimize their content strategy and enhance user engagement. 

## Tools
The analysis was conducted using the R programming language, utilizing various statistical and data visualization tools. 

Packages used:

#### dplyr
#### ggplot2
#### tidyr
