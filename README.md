# The Impact of Facebook Post Features on Consumer Engagement

## Abstract
This report offers a predictive analysis of user interactions with Facebook posts, using a dataset encompassing various engagement metrics from a cosmetics brand's page. The study aims to construct a model to forecast the `Lifetime.Post.Consumers` count by examining eight specific input features related to post content and timing. Employing linear regression techniques, we analyze posts to identify significant predictors of consumer engagement. The results confirm that certain variables, such as post type and hour, significantly affect user interactions. The model demonstrates proficiency in predicting user engagement, providing insights for optimizing social media marketing strategies.  

## Dataset
The worldwide dissemination of social media was triggered by the exponential growth of Internet users, leading to a completely new environment for customers to exchange ideas and feedback about products and services. The number of social network users in 2010 was 0.97 billion and was projected to increase to 2.44 billion users by 2018, i.e. an increase of around 300% in 8 years. Social media may become the most important media channel for brands to reach their clients. Moro et al. study the effect on the `Lifetime.Post.Consumers` with respect to the 7 input features: `category`, `page total likes`, `type`, `month`, `hour`, `weekday`, `paid`.
