# The Impact of Facebook Post Features on Consumer Engagement

## Description
In the dynamic realm of digital marketing, the need for predictive models in social media has grown significantly. This project addresses a critical gap by focusing on forecasting user interactions with Facebook posts prior to their publication, utilizing linear regression analysis to develop a practical predictive tool. The aim is to enhance corporate communications' effectiveness on social networks, specifically focusing on predicting the number of unique users who interact with a post over its lifetime on a cosmetics brand's Facebook page. This metric denotes the number of unique users who interact with a post over its lifetime. The study employs a dataset from a cosmetics brand's Facebook page, incorporating eight key variables. The data is divided into 'Training' and 'Validation' sets to construct and validate the predictive model. Through rigorous analysis, the project uncovers insights into consumer engagement dynamics. The project concludes with strategic recommendations for businesses, highlighting actionable insights derived from the predictive model. These insights can guide corporate communication strategies on social media platforms, helping brands optimize their engagement efforts and enhance overall performance.
